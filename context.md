   - Correcting the resolver export structure in `src/index.js` and `src/admin.js`
   - Adding all missing resolver functions that the frontend was trying to call
   - Removing duplicate export statements that were causing syntax errors

2. **File Cleanup**: Removed duplicate and backup files:
   - Moved backup files to `.backup.old` extension
   - Deleted optimized versions (`analysisResolverOptimized.js`, `claudeSonnet4ServiceOptimized.js`, `queueManagerOptimized.js`)
   - Cleaned up the resolver and services directories

3. **Added Missing Resolver Functions**: The frontend was calling functions that didn't exist, causing the "out is not a constructor" error. Added:
   - `getUserConfig` - Gets user configuration and preferences
   - `validateContent` - Validates meeting content before analysis  
   - `startAnalysis` - Starts async meeting analysis with progress tracking
   - `getAnalysisStatus` - Polls analysis progress and results
   - `processDirectText` - Immediate text processing without queuing

4. **Deployment Status**: Successfully deployed to development environment (v7.3.0)

## Current Resolver Functions âœ…

### Main Resolver (`src/index.js`)
- `analyzeText` - Basic text analysis with word/sentence counts
- `saveAnalysis` - Save analysis results to storage
- `getAnalysisHistory` - Retrieve user's analysis history  
- `healthCheck` - System health verification
- `testConnection` - Storage connectivity test
- `getUserConfig` - User preferences and configuration
- `validateContent` - Content validation before processing
- `startAnalysis` - Async analysis with progress tracking
- `getAnalysisStatus` - Analysis progress and results retrieval
- `processDirectText` - Immediate text processing

### Admin Resolver (`src/admin.js`)  
- `verifyAdmin` - Admin access verification
- `getSystemStatus` - System operational status
- `updateConfiguration` - App configuration management

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.x on Atlassian Forge
- **Storage**: Forge built-in storage API (key-value store)
- **Security**: Forge sandboxed environment with scoped permissions
- **AI Integration**: Ready for Claude Sonnet 4 API integration

### Frontend  
- **Framework**: React 18+ with Vite build system
- **Bridge**: Forge Bridge API for backend communication
- **Styling**: Component-scoped CSS with inline styles
- **Components**: Lazy-loaded components for performance

### Development Tools
- **Package Manager**: npm with workspaces
- **Linting**: ESLint with security plugins
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Build**: Forge CLI with automatic bundling

## Permissions & Security
- **Jira Scopes**: `read:jira-work`, `storage:app`  
- **Admin Access**: Restricted through Jira admin pages
- **Data Isolation**: User-scoped storage keys
- **Content Security**: Input validation and sanitization

## Next Steps ðŸš€

1. **AI Integration**: Connect Claude Sonnet 4 API for real analysis
2. **Enhanced UI**: Improve visual design and user experience  
3. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error boundaries
4. **Performance**: Implement caching and optimization
5. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
6. **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation

## Recent Changes (Latest)
- âœ… Fixed "out is not a constructor" error
- âœ… Added all missing resolver functions
- âœ… Cleaned up duplicate files and exports
- âœ… Deployed successfully to development environment
- âœ… Frontend can now communicate with backend without errors

## Known Issues ðŸ”§
- Mock data is being used instead of real Claude AI analysis
- Some 404 errors in browser console are from Jira's own systems (not our app)
- Content Security Policy warnings are from Jira's security restrictions (normal)
